### StyleTransfer

#### What it does
Ever wondered how a photo would be look like if it was painted by some famous artist. Well the state of the art deep learning algorithms has made it possible to achieve these tasks.
This deep learning software does the same.

#### How it works
* It takes two input images one is the content image and another one is the style image. The style image is the famous painting and the content image is the picture which we want to convert.
* Now to achieve this task I first generated a random noise image which is somewhat similar to my original image. 
* I defined two cost functions one will be for the style image and another will be for the content image.
* Now a final cost function as the sum of these two cost functions with two hyper parameteres alpha and beta is created. Alpha and beta will control the amount of style I want in my image.
* I reduced the cost generated by this cost function using Adam's optimization algorithm and after few iterations our image will start to transform.
* And we will get beautiful results.
Fantastics isn't it.
